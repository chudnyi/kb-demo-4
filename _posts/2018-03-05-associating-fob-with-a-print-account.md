<u><em><strong></strong></em></u>The first time you use the printer you must associate your fob with your Spacekraft user account.

Present your fob to the reader on the left with the red light, it will beep twice. The following screen will appear requesting you to enter your account credentials.<br>&nbsp;

Enter your account credentials. If you have not reset your password please do that first.

Once you have successfully associated your card, the next time you use the printer you will only need to use your fob and won't have to enter your username/password again.
