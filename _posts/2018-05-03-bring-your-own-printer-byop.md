If you would like to connect your own printer to the network please follow the steps below:

## 1. Connect your printer to the network

Connect your printer to a wired network jack or wireless via WiFi.

Network Jack - simply plug it in via a physical ethernet cable to a free network jack in your office

WiFi - Connect your printer to the *Spacekraft Shared* wireless network. Ask the Space Manager for the network password.

## 2. Email our IT team to complete setup

Once you have successfully connected your printer to the network, please email [support@cmpny.com](mailto:support@cmpny.com?subject=BYOP%20Request&amp;body=Name%3A%0ACMPNY%20Location%3A%0AOffice%20%23%3A%0APrinter%20MAC%20address%3A) with the below information:

* Name
* CMPNY Location
* Office #
* Printer MAC address (see below to find it)

### How to find printer MAC address

It will be in one of the following formats:

```bash
e0:55:3d:8c:c3:f3
e0-55-3d-8c-c3-f3
e0553d8cc3f3
E0:55:3D:8C:C3:F3
E0-55-3D-8C-C3-F3
E0553D8CC3F3
```

1. Look at the product manual cover. Some manufacturers attach a MAC address label to the printer manual. This is usually noted with the legend: “Physical Address” or “MAC Address.” If this label is absent, proceed to the next step.
2. Consult the manual for instructions on printing the device's configuration page.
3. &nbsp;Find a sticker on the printer that says “Physical Address” or "MAC Address".
